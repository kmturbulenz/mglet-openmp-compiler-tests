### 08-type-procedures

Tests if procedures of a derived type can be called in a target region and access its members based on a custom mapper.

Use case: Derived type mimics MGLET's field type consisting of initializer, some read/write prodcedure and a destructor. This test omits the increased complexity of the inheritance structure in MGLET and only shows the basic functionality works.
