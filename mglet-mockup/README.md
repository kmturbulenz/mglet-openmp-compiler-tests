### mglet-mockup

Combines the functionality that is verified in the other test cases into a larger example
closely mirroring MGLET's architecture and programming paradigms.

Compilation options:
- `-D_INDEX_`: uses indexing approach in compute loop instead of explicitly constructing pointer
- `-D_NO_CUSTOM_DEFAULT_MAPPER_`: avoids the definition of default custom mappers
